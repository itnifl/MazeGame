# Suggested Requirements

## Candidate Additions

### F25 follow-on — Ghost Visibility Level (identified during implementation)

- **SR-51:** Once F16 (DSL / scripted scenario support) is complete, `Ghost.visibilityLevel` shall be configurable via the scenario DSL so level designers can specify per-ghost opacity caps without editing the raw XMI model. The DSL entry shall be validated against the `[0, 100]` domain constraint defined in the Ecore metamodel, and invalid values shall produce a clear authoring-time error.

- **SR-52:** The HUD shall display a low-visibility warning indicator when the active area contains a ghost whose `visibilityLevel` is below a configurable threshold (default 40). The indicator shall be rendered in both the JavaFX and libGDX frontends using the shared `UiScheduler` / HUD facade to maintain CRR-5 parity. This extends the scope defined in SR-16 (HUD observability).

- **SR-53:** Observability — when `Ghost.visibilityLevel` drives a computed opacity that deviates by more than 5 % from `visibilityLevel / 100.0` (i.e. the phasing cap is active), a structured debug-level log entry shall be emitted by `GhostNonTangibilityService` including `energy`, `visibilityLevel`, `baseOpacity`, and `clampedOpacity`. The log entry shall be suppressible in production builds via the standard Java `Logger` level mechanism and shall not allocate on the hot path when the level is disabled.

### JavaFX MVC + Command/Registry refactor (Phase 5 of `docs/plans/javafx-gamecontroller-mvc-command-refactor.md`)

These requirements bring the JavaFX frontend to structural parity (CRR-5) with the libGDX MVC + Command/Registry architecture. They are scheduled to be ratified in Phase 5 of the JavaFX refactor plan, on a dedicated branch and pull request separate from the libGDX round.

- SR-42: The Command and key binding registry input core (logical action enum, key binding registry, input frame contract, input router, edge key tracker, and command/context types) shall be shared in `maze-common-frontend` and consumed by both frontends. The dispatch loop shall be generalized over a frontend neutral key type (or a neutral key code with a per frontend adapter) so adding a new key or action does not require modifying the router. libGDX shall be migrated to consume the promoted types so it keeps compiling and its existing input tests stay green.
- SR-43: JavaFX gameplay input shall be handled via the shared key binding registry resolving logical actions to command objects, replacing the inline `handleKeyPressed` switch on `KeyCode`. Key polling shall be centralized in one JavaFX input snapshot reader, and movement, terminal, high scores, spanning tree, path hint, and return to menu shall each be expressed as a command without scattered keyboard checks in the controller.
- SR-44: JavaFX gameplay mutable runtime state shall live in a dedicated model boundary, separate from lifecycle, rendering, input, and FXML concerns, so the controller coordinates behavior without directly owning every gameplay field.
- SR-50: During JavaFX input migration to command and registry architecture, command dispatch shall emit lightweight structured diagnostics (command name, input action, and mode) through a frontend neutral observability hook enabled in debug builds. This shall support parity troubleshooting between JavaFX and libGDX without changing gameplay behavior.

## Ratified Requirements

These requirements have been implemented and verified.

- SR-42: The Command and key binding registry input core is shared in `maze-common-frontend` and consumed by both frontends. The dispatch loop is generalized over a frontend-neutral key type, allowing new keys/actions to be added without modifying the router. libGDX has been migrated to consume the promoted types.
- SR-43: JavaFX gameplay input is handled via the shared key binding registry, resolving logical actions to command objects and replacing the inline `handleKeyPressed` switch. Key polling is centralized, and all actions are expressed as commands.
- SR-44: JavaFX gameplay mutable runtime state lives in a dedicated model (`FxGameWorldModel`), separate from lifecycle, rendering, input, and FXML concerns.
- SR-46: The JavaFX movement thread, animation timer, and watchdog are owned by a dedicated concurrency coordinator (`FxMovementLoopCoordinator`) with unchanged lifecycle semantics.
- SR-46: The JavaFX movement thread, animation timer, and watchdog are owned by a dedicated concurrency coordinator (`FxMovementLoopCoordinator`) with unchanged lifecycle semantics.
- SR-47: JavaFX mode-specific update logic is dispatched by the shared `GameModeRouter` to `FxPlayingModeController`, which owns input routing, route-hint penalty accrual, player movement throttling, and camera follow for the PLAYING mode.
- SR-48: JavaFX frame rendering is orchestrated by `FxGameRenderCoordinator`, which computes camera translation for windowed and fullscreen modes with correct player centre-follow and edge clamping.
- SR-49: JavaFX audio transitions are encapsulated behind a dedicated coordinator (`FxGameAudioCoordinator`) over `GameAudioDirector`.
- SR-45: JavaFX gameplay start and reset flow is encapsulated in `FxGameSessionBootstrapper`, which initializes board sizing, background, maze world, player configuration, player character, canvases (in correct z-order), and enemy spawning. The spawning step is injectable via `BiConsumer<EnemyRegistrar, Difficulty>` to decouple tests from the EMF/XMI model stack. `GameController.setupGame()` delegates to the bootstrapper and wires the resulting objects to actions, subscribers, and the mode router.
